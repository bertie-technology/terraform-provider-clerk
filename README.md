# Terraform Provider for Clerk

A Terraform provider for managing Clerk resources. This provider uses:

- The official [Clerk Go SDK](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-sdk-go) for interacting with the Clerk API
- HashiCorp's [Terraform Plugin Framework](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/framework) for a modern, type-safe provider implementation

## Current Scope

This provider currently supports:

- **Organizations** - Create, read, update, and delete Clerk organizations

Additional resources may be added in future versions.

## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) >= 1.0
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) >= 1.25 (for development)
- A Clerk account with an API key

## Building the Provider

Clone the repository and build the provider:

```bash
make build
# Or manually:
mkdir -p bin
go build -o bin/terraform-provider-clerk
```

## Installing the Provider

### Local Development

For local development, you can use the following `~/.terraformrc` configuration to tell Terraform where to find your local provider:

```hcl
provider_installation {
  dev_overrides {
    "registry.terraform.io/bertie-technology/clerk" = "/Users/bertie-technology/Documents/work/terraform-clerk-organization/bin"
  }

  direct {}
}
```

Replace the path with the absolute path to your `bin/` directory containing the built provider binary.

## Using the Provider

### Provider Configuration

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    clerk = {
      source = "bertie-technology/clerk"
      version = "~> 0.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "clerk" {
  api_key = "your-clerk-api-key"  # Or set CLERK_API_KEY environment variable
}
```

### Resources

  max_allowed_memberships = 100

  public_metadata = jsonencode({
