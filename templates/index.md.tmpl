# Clerk Provider

The Clerk provider allows you to manage [Clerk](https://clerk.com) resources using Terraform.

Currently, this provider supports managing Clerk organizations. Additional resources may be added in future versions.

## Example Usage

{{tffile "examples/provider/provider.tf"}}

## Authentication

The provider requires a Clerk API key for authentication. You can obtain an API key from your Clerk dashboard.

### Using Environment Variables (Recommended)

```bash
export CLERK_API_KEY="sk_test_your_api_key_here"
terraform plan
```

### Using Provider Configuration

While you can set the API key directly in your Terraform configuration, it's recommended to use environment variables to avoid exposing sensitive data.

## Schema

### Required

- `api_key` (String, Sensitive) Clerk API Key. Can also be set via `CLERK_API_KEY` environment variable.

## Resources

- [clerk_organization](./resources/organization.md)
